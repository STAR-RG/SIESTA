anonymized,5,4,It was sufficient in most of the cases,5,4,It was good to know that I am learning and that I could finish the exercise without any further questions
anonymized,5,5,"Yes, it was sufficient in every case I analyzed.",3,4,Because I learned a little bit about how Java Docs specifies its contracts
anonymized,4,5,It was sufficient in most of the cases,3,5,It's important to know how to specify certain peculiarities of the code and an exercise for that purpose makes this clearer.
anonymized,5,3,"I almost always needes some extra info. For example, to read other parts of the API or to look for examples on the web.",5,4," There was a relative disparity in the difficulty of some issues when compared to others. Some were too easy and some relatively hard. On the other hand it was satisfying because, for me, it was a novelty to specify API properties."

anonymized,4,5,It was sufficient in most of the cases,3,4,"I enjoyed this exercise because we could apply testing concepts to a well-known API like Java. It's always good to practice class concepts in ""real"" environments.  One matter to improve that I can mention is the activity definition. I watched the video and read the spec docs but I still had a few doubts related to the answer syntax we should write. Although the docs update you did today responded the doubts I had, it would be nice if we could follow this pattern for the next activities so we can have the full context once the activity is launched because in this case, for instance, I had already done the activity when the update was posted because I work 8h per day so I tend to organize myself to do college assignments in advance."

It also was a very practical task, which always is better than a more conceptual one."

Also, some properties are very tricky to be correctly verified in runtime and would be easier identified in compilation time."
