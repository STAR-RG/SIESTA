# SIESTA

SIESTA stands for the Simple ImperativE SpecificaTion lAnguage, a minimalist specification language for expressing properties. It is built on top of Java, which is the programming language whose API properties we wanted to specify, and the language that lots of developers are familiar with. It includes the minimal number of features necessary to express various kinds of behavioral properties. We do *not* aim for generality.

This repository is organized according to the following structure: 

- the [`replication-package`](replication-package) folder contains the dataset of properties from PropertyDB, the language specification document, the applied questionnaires, and students' responses;
- the [`prototype`](prototype) folder contains the tool prototype for using the language.
